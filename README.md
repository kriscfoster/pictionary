# Pictionary

During the 2020 holiday season, we were playing some games of
Pictionary. We were using some apps/websites for generating
random words/things to draw. However, none of these really fulfilled
what we needed. Decided to build a simple pictionary word generator web
application to do what we wanted.

## Website
Live at https://pictionary-banter.herokuapp.com

## Adding New Words
* Add the word to `words.txt`.
* Run `node ./populateSQL.js`.

## Running Locally
This is a Spring Boot Kotlin application. Opening the project in any Java IDE
(e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) should make it easy to run the application.
